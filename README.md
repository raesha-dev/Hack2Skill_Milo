Milo — Your Digital Buddy for Youth Mental Wellness 🌸

Milo is a friendly digital companion designed to support youth mental wellness. It lives inside an Instagram-style chat and offers daily check-ins, encouragement, mood tracking, and safe support — like a friend who’s always there.


Features

Daily Friendly DMs: Milo sends check-ins, birthday wishes, or encouragement messages.

Mood Logging: Track your emotions, which visually bloom into a flower garden over time.

Calm Practices: Quick 30-second exercises for stress relief and mindfulness.

Gamified Emotional Growth: Track progress in a fun, engaging way.

Anonymous Support Rooms: Connect with peers who share similar feelings.

Safety Net: Detects risky or self-harm language, comforts the user, and guides them to professional help.

OpenAI GPT: Powers Milo’s personality and friendly conversation.

Google Cloud NLP: Analyzes moods and sentiment.
